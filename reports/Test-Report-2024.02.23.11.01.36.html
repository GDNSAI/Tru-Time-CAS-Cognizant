Product Inventory System

1. Skill Description:
The assignment is designed to assess and develop your understanding of Core Java
concepts, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, and the use of
constructors. You will apply these skills to create a product inventory system that
models products, orders, and customers.
2. Prerequisite:
Basic knowledge of Java syntax, data types, variables, and the concept of OOP
(classes and objects). Understanding how to use constructors in Java is also required.
3. Scenario:
You are developing a simple product inventory and order management system for a
small online store. The store sells various products, each with a name, price, and
quantity in stock. Customers can place orders for products. You will model the
system using classes, variables, constructors, and objects. Your task is to:
1. Define classes for products and orders.
2. Use constructors to initialize objects.
3. Display product and order details.
4. Task:
You will complete the following:
o Create a class Product to represent a product with the following attributes:
 productName (String)
 price (double)
 quantityInStock (int)

o Create a class Order to represent an order with the following attributes:
 customerName (String)
 product (Product type)
 orderAmount (double)
o Use constructors in both classes to initialize the attributes:
 The Product class should have a constructor that takes productName,
price, and quantityInStock.
 The Order class should have two constructors:
 One that takes customerName and product (using a default
orderAmount of 100.0).
 Another that takes all three parameters: customerName,
product, and orderAmount.

o In the main method, create two Product objects and two Order objects.
o Display the details of the products and orders.
5. Instructions:
o Step 1: Create a class named Product with the following attributes:
 productName (String)
 price (double)
 quantityInStock (int)
o Step 2: Create a constructor in the Product class that initializes the attributes
using the provided parameters.
o Step 3: Create a class named Order with the following attributes:
 customerName (String)
 product (Product type)
 orderAmount (double)
o Step 4: Create two constructors in the Order class:
 The first constructor should take customerName and product, setting
the orderAmount to a default value of 100.0.

 The second constructor should take all three parameters:
customerName, product, and orderAmount.
o Step 5: In the main method, create two Product objects:
 Product 1: &quot;Wireless Mouse&quot;, 29.99, 150
 Product 2: &quot;Smartphone&quot;, 499.99, 80
o Step 6: Create two Order objects:
 Order 1: Customer: &quot;Alice&quot;, Product: Wireless Mouse (use the default
orderAmount)
 Order 2: Customer: &quot;Bob&quot;, Product: Smartphone, Order Amount:
499.99

o Step 7: Display the details of both the products and the orders using
System.out.println().

6. Input:
No input from the user; use hardcoded values for creating products and orders.
7. Sample Dataset:
Product 1:
Product Name: Wireless Mouse
Price: 29.99
Quantity in Stock: 150
Product 2:
Product Name: Smartphone
Price: 499.99
Quantity in Stock: 80
Order 1:
Customer Name: Alice
Product: Wireless Mouse
Order Amount: 100.0 (default)
Order 2:

Customer Name: Bob
Product: Smartphone
Order Amount: 499.99
8. Expected Outcome:
The program should output the following:
Product Details:
Product Name: Wireless Mouse
Price: 29.99
Quantity in Stock: 150

Product Details:
Product Name: Smartphone
Price: 499.99
Quantity in Stock: 80

Order Details:
Customer Name: Alice
Product: Wireless Mouse
Order Amount: 100.0

Order Details:
Customer Name: Bob
Product: Smartphone
Order Amount: 499.99
9. Learning Outcome:
By completing this assignment, learners will:
o Gain hands-on experience with Java variables and data types.

o Learn how to define and use classes and objects.
o Understand how constructors are used to initialize objects with specific
values.
o Develop the ability to model real-world entities (products and orders) using
Java&#39;s OOP principles.
