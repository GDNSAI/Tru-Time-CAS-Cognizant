You've got a string S of length N, and your goal is to find pairs of integers (i, j) that meet the following two conditions:
1≤i≤ j ≤ N
S[i] = si
To do this, you'll first create a series of strings by removing a single character from S at each position from 1 to N. Then, you'll count how many pairs of integers (i, j) satisfy the given conditions.
Function Description:
In the provided code, you have a method named "numberOfEqualStrings()". Your task is
to complete this method to calculate and return the number of pairs of integers (i, j) that
meet the specified conditions. Write your code below the comment "Write Code Here".
There will be multiple test cases, so ensure that your code handles different inputs and produces the correct outputs.

Requirements are as follows:
1) Base Robot Class: Create an abstract base class Robot that includes common attributes such as the current position (x, y) and direction it's facing, use 'N' for North, 'E' for East, 'S' for South, 'W' for West as follows:
Class Variables:
x (protected int): Represents the robot's current horizontal position on the grid. Protected access allows this variable to be accessed directly by subclasses.
*y (protected int): Represents the robot's current vertical position
on the grid. Like x, it is protected to be accessible within subclasses.
* direction (protected char): Indicates the current facing direction of the robot, which can be 'N' (North), 'E' (East), 'S' (South), or 'W' (West). The direction affects how the robot moves when the move method is called.
Constructor:
- Robot(int startX, int starty, char ch): Initializes a new instance of a Robot.
- startX: The initial horizontal position (x-coordinate) of the robot on the grid.
- startY: The initial vertical position (y-coordinate) of the robot on the grid.
ch: The initial direction the robot is facing. This should be one of the allowed direction characters ('N', 'E', 'S', 'W').

* move(): Moves the robot one unit forward in the direction it is currently facing.
* turn_left(): Rotates the robot 90 degrees counter-clockwise (left) without changing its position. * turn_right(): Rotates the robot 90 degrees clockwise (right) without changing its position.
* executelnstructions(String instructions): An abstract method that subclasses must implement to define how the robot processes a string of movement instructions. This method is intended to allow different types of robots to respond to a sequence of commands (like 'move', 'turn_left', 'turn_right').
2) StandardRobot Subclass:
Create a subclass StandardRobot from Robot.
* Constructor: Initializes a new instance of Standard Robot with specific starting coordinates and a character representatior
